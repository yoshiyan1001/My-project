Percertron is an algorithm for supervised learning of single layer binary linear classifiers. 
    At this program, we see two different groups on the plot. 
    Perceptron Algorithm tries to classify those by the linear line. 
    There are three different datasets as I mentioned above. 
    The first dataset called 'easy' can be classfied in a few times. 
    The second one called 'hard' cannnot be classfied, and it needs many tranning the linear line goes to the center of two groups. 
    The third dataset called 'random' ovbiously cannot be classified.
